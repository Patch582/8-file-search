# 8-file-search
Text search app - created as part of learning Python

I'm learning Python by doing a JumpStart course.

This App takes as input: 1. simple text string 2. Starting directory

Will search through all the files in the directory and subsequent lower level directories

The results are presented as a "Count Of: "
